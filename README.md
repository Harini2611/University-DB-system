# University-DB-system

I created 5 classes (University, Person, Student, Course and Instructor) in which I followed the 
instructions given by the class diagram and created different functions, variables and constructors. Iâ€™ve 
also inherited Students and Instructors (derived classes) classes from Person class (Base class). The 
Tester class was lastly built to bring together all the other classes and operate the console. Objects were 
created for University, Student, Instructor and Course.
Tests were done to demonstrate proficiency.
